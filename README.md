## Selection Modes Explained

The app supports three different sampling logics for picking your entertainment option:

- **Normal**: Standard weighted random selection based on your preset weights for each activity. No special logic is applied.
- **Variety Boost**: Activities that have been picked less often in recent days are more likely to be chosen. This helps you try new things and avoid repeating the same activity too often.
- **Avoid Recent**: Activities that were picked in the last 7 days are much less likely to be chosen (but not impossible). This mode encourages you to rotate through your options and avoid repeats.

You can select the mode from the dropdown in the app before making your pick.
